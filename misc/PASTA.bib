  abstract = {Spatial omics technologies are increasingly leveraged to characterize how disease disrupts tissue organization and cellular niches. While multiple methods to analyze spatial variation within a sample have been published, statistical and computational approaches to compare cell spatial organization across samples or conditions are mostly lacking. We present GraphCompass, a comprehensive set of omics-adapted graph analysis methods to quantitatively evaluate and compare the spatial arrangement of cells in samples representing diverse biological conditions. GraphCompass builds upon the Squidpy spatial omics toolbox and encompasses various statistical approaches to perform cross-condition analyses at the level of individual cell types, niches, and samples. Additionally, GraphCompass provides custom visualization functions that enable effective communication of results. We demonstrate how GraphCompass can be used to address key biological questions, such as how cellular organization and tissue architecture differ across various disease states and which spatial patterns correlate with a given pathological condition. GraphCompass can be applied to various popular omics techniques, including, but not limited to, spatial proteomics (e.g. MIBI-TOF), spot-based transcriptomics (e.g. 10{\texttimes} Genomics Visium), and single-cell resolved transcriptomics (e.g. Stereo-seq). In this work, we showcase the capabilities of GraphCompass through its application to three different studies that may also serve as benchmark datasets for further method development. With its easy-to-use implementation, extensive documentation, and comprehensive tutorials, GraphCompass is accessible to biologists with varying levels of computational expertise. By facilitating comparative analyses of cell spatial organization, GraphCompass promises to be a valuable asset in advancing our understanding of tissue function in health and disease.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

Its key concepts of ``near'' and ``related'' are intuitive in a univariate setting. However, when moving to the joint consideration of spatial patterns among multiple variables, the combination of attribute similarity and geographical similarity that underlies the concept of spatial autocorrelation is much harder to deal with. This article uses the notion of distance in multiattribute space to explore and visualize the connection between ``near'' and ``related'' in a multivariate context. We approach this from a global, local, and regional perspective. We outline a number of ways to combine different visualization techniques and introduce a new local neighbor match test for multivariate local clusters. We illustrate the methods by means of Guerry's classic data set on moral statistics in 1833 France.},

In this paper, we explore a set of new summary statistics -- the k-Nearest Neighbour Cumulative Distribution Functions (kNN-CDF). This is the empirical cumulative distribution function of distances from a set of volume-filling, Poisson distributed random points to the k-nearest data points, and is sensitive to all connected N-point correlations in the data. The kNN-CDF can be used to measure counts in cell, void probability distributions, and higher N-point correlation functions, all using the same formalism exploiting fast searches with spatial tree data structures. We demonstrate how it can be computed efficiently from various data sets -- both discrete points, and the generalization for continuous fields. We use data from a large suite of N-body simulations to explore the sensitivity of this new statistic to various cosmological parameters, compared to the two-point correlation function, while using the same range of scales. We demonstrate that the use of kNN-CDF improves the constraints on the cosmological parameters by more than a factor of 2 when applied to the clustering of dark matter in the range of scales between 10 and \$40{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\$. We also show that relative improvement is even greater when applied on the same scales to the clustering of haloes in the simulations at a fixed number density, both in real space, as well as in redshift space. Since the kNN-CDF are sensitive to all higher order connected correlation functions in the data, the gains over traditional two-point analyses are expected to grow as progressively smaller scales are included in the analysis of cosmological data, provided the higher order correlation functions are sensitive to cosmology on the scales of interest.},

This pattern characterizes biological mechanism involved within a forest with the spatial localization of the trees. If we consider simultaneously two species, the main question is not to describe the marginal distribution of each species but to describe the relationship between the repartitions of the two species under study. The relationship between two clouds of points can be described in various ways and therefore many indices can be defined. Each index will give a specific information about these relationships and will greatly depends on the ecological mechanisms, i.e., the point process that leads to the observed repartition. The aim of this article is to review the leading indices in ecology and to provide guidelines for practical use. To mimic ecological situations, we simulated 13 point process that can model classical relationships between two species of trees and compute nine classical indices. The interest of the various indices are discussed. A R package for simulating the point process and to compute the indices is available on request.

This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

  abstract = {Advances in multiplexed imaging technologies have drastically improved our ability to characterize healthy and diseased tissues at the single-cell level. Co-detection by indexing (CODEX) relies on DNA-conjugated antibodies and the cyclic addition and removal of complementary fluorescently labeled DNA probes and has been used so far to simultaneously visualize up to 60 markers in situ. CODEX enables a deep view into the single-cell spatial relationships in tissues and is intended to spur discovery in developmental biology, disease and therapeutic design. Herein, we provide optimized protocols for conjugating purified antibodies to DNA oligonucleotides, validating the conjugation by CODEX staining and executing the CODEX multicycle imaging procedure for both formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh-frozen tissues. In addition, we describe basic image processing and data analysis procedures. We apply this approach to an FFPE human tonsil multicycle experiment. The hands-on experimental time for antibody conjugation is {\textasciitilde}4.5 h, validation of DNA-conjugated antibodies with CODEX staining takes {\textasciitilde}6.5 h and preparation for a CODEX multicycle experiment takes {\textasciitilde}8 h. The multicycle imaging and data analysis time depends on the tissue size, number of markers in the panel and computational complexity.},

  abstract = {AbstractSpatial clustering has important implications in various fields. In particular, disease clustering is of major public concern in epidemiology. In this article, we propose the use of two distance-based segregation indices to test the significance of disease clustering among subjects whose locations are from a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous population. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the segregation indices and compare them with other distance-based disease clustering tests in terms of empirical size and power by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The null pattern we consider is the random labeling (RL) of cases and controls to the given locations. Along this line, we investigate the sensitivity of the size of these tests to the underlying background pattern (e.g., clustered or homogenous) on which the RL is applied, the level of clustering and number of clusters, or to differences in relative abundances of the classes. We demonstrate that differences in relative abundances have the highest influence on the empirical sizes of the tests. We also propose various non-RL patterns as alternatives to the RL pattern and assess the empirical power performances of the tests under these alternatives. We observe that the empirical size of one of the indices is more robust to the differences in relative abundances, and this index performs comparable with the best performers in literature in terms of power. We illustrate the methods on two real-life examples from epidemiology. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify. They are computationally efficient, applicable to a broad range of study questions, and freely available in open source software.},

IMC enabled simultaneous measurement of 35 biomarkers with single-cell and spatial resolution. We performed pseudotime analysis of islets through T1D progression from snapshot data to reconstruct the evolution of {$\beta$} cell loss and insulitis. Our analyses revealed that {$\beta$} cell destruction is preceded by a {$\beta$} cell marker loss and by recruitment of cytotoxic and helper T~cells. The approaches described herein demonstrate the value of IMC for improving our understanding of T1D pathogenesis, and our data lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and follow-on experiments.},

Nearest-neighbor contingency tables for two species can be analyzed using the methods in Dixon (1994). Here, I present methods to analyze contingency tables for any number of species. Calculation and interpretation of the multispecies contingency table are illustrated by two examples: spatial segregation of species in a swamp forest, with five types of points (Fraxinus caroliniana, Nyssa sylvatica, Nyssa aquatica, Taxodium disticum, and ``other species''), and spatial segregation in the gamodioecious tree Nyssa aquatica, with three types of points (male, female, and juvenile). Two issues that affect the results and their interpretation are the choice of randomization (random labelling or toroidal rotation) and the choice of test (pairwise or multispecies).},

Here, we apply single-cell RNA-sequencing to human inflamed intestine and show that the largest differences among patients are present within the myeloid compartment including macrophages and neutrophils. Using spatial transcriptomics in human tissue at single-cell resolution (CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging) we spatially localize each of the macrophage and neutrophil subsets identified by single-cell RNA-sequencing and unravel further macrophage diversity based on their tissue localization. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with single-cell spatial analysis reveals a strong communication network involving macrophages and inflammatory fibroblasts. Our data sheds light on the cellular complexity of these diseases and points towards the myeloid and stromal compartments as important cellular subsets for understanding patient-to-patient heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {ATAC-seq has emerged as a rich epigenome profiling technique, and is commonly used to identify Transcription Factors (TFs) underlying given phenomena. A number of methods can be used to identify differentially-active TFs through the accessibility of their DNA-binding motif, however little is known on the best approaches for doing so. Here we benchmark several such methods using a combination of curated datasets with various forms of short-term perturbations on known TFs, as well as semi-simulations. We include both methods specifically designed for this type of data as well as some that can be repurposed for it. We also investigate variations to these methods, and identify three particularly promising approaches (chromVAR-limma with critical adjustments, monaLisa and a combination of GC smooth quantile normalization and multivariate modeling). We further investigate the specific use of nucleosome-free fragments, the combination of top methods, and the impact of technical variation. Finally, we illustrate the use of the top methods on a novel dataset to characterize the impact on DNA accessibility of TRAnscription Factor TArgeting Chimeras (TRAFTAC), which can deplete TFs -- in our case NFkB -- at the protein level.},

The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statistics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and Gi* statistics enable us to detect local ``pockets'' of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.},

We used TissueNet to train Mesmer, a deep-learning-enabled segmentation algorithm. We demonstrated that Mesmer is more accurate than previous methods, generalizes to the full diversity of tissue types and imaging platforms in TissueNet, and achieves human-level performance. Mesmer enabled the automated extraction of key cellular features, such as subcellular localization of protein signal, which was challenging with previous approaches. We then adapted Mesmer to harness cell lineage information in highly multiplexed datasets and used this enhanced version to quantify cell morphology changes during human gestation.

Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.},

Through graph convolution, SpaGCN aggregates gene expression of each spot from its neighboring spots, which enables the identification of spatial domains with coherent expression and histology. The subsequent domain guided differential expression (DE) analysis then detects genes with enriched expression patterns in the identified domains. Analyzing seven SRT datasets using SpaGCN, we show it can detect genes with much more enriched spatial expression patterns than competing methods. Furthermore, genes detected by SpaGCN are transferrable and can be utilized to study spatial variation of gene expression in other datasets. SpaGCN is computationally fast, platform independent, making it a desirable tool for diverse SRT studies.},

Given its versatility and sample back-compatibility, MIBI-TOF is positioned to leverage existing annotated, archival tissue cohorts to explore emerging questions in cancer, immunology, and neurobiology.}

  abstract = {A method is described for localizing DNA sequences hybridized in situ to Drosophila polytene chromosomes. This procedure utilizes a biotin-labeled analog of TTP that can be incorporated enzymatically into DNA probes by nick-translation. After hybridization in situ, the biotin molecules in the probe serve as antigens which bind affinity-purified rabbit antibiotin antibodies. The site of hybridization is then detected either fluorimetrically, by using fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, or cytochemically, by using an anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. When combined with Giemsa staining, the immunoperoxidase detection method provides a permanent record that is suitable for detailed cytogenetic analysis. This immunological approach offers four advantages over conventional autoradiographic procedures for detecting in situ hybrids: (i) the time required to determine the site of hybridization is decreased markedly, (ii) biotin-labeled probes are chemically stable and give reproducible results for many months; (iii) biotin-labeled probes appear to produce less background noise than do radiolabeled probes; and (iv) the resolving power is equal to and often greater than that achieved autoradiographically.},

Here, we introduce SpatialDM, a statistical model and toolbox leveraging a bivariant Moran's statistic to detect spatially co-expressed ligand and receptor pairs, their local interacting spots (single-spot resolution), and communication patterns. By deriving an analytical null distribution, this method is scalable to millions of spots and shows accurate and robust performance in various simulations. On multiple datasets including melanoma, Ventricular-Subventricular Zone, and intestine, SpatialDM reveals promising communication patterns and identifies differential interactions between conditions, hence enabling the discovery of context-specific cell cooperation and signalling.},

Moreover, we find radiotherapy is sufficient for interconversion of neural crest schwannomas to immune-enriched schwannomas through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. To define mechanisms underlying schwannoma groups, we develop a technique for simultaneous interrogation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression coupled with genetic and therapeutic perturbations in single-nuclei. Our results elucidate a framework for understanding epigenetic drivers of tumor evolution and establish a paradigm of epigenetic and metabolic reprograming of cancer cells that shapes the immune microenvironment in response to radiotherapy.},

Here, we report a method for spatially resolved epigenomic profiling of single cells using in situ tagmentation and transcription followed by multiplexed imaging. We demonstrated the ability to profile histone modifications marking active promoters, putative enhancers, and silent promoters in individual cells, and generated high-resolution spatial atlas of hundreds of active promoters and putative enhancers in embryonic and adult mouse brains.

Using simulated and real vessel reporting data, the properties of this new interpretation of spatial mutual information are explored.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle repair is driven by the coordinated self-renewal and fusion of myogenic stem and progenitor cells. Single-cell gene expression analyses of myogenesis have been hampered by the poor sampling of rare and transient cell states that are critical for muscle repair, and do not inform the spatial context that is important for myogenic differentiation. Here, we demonstrate how large-scale integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data can overcome these limitations. We created a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of mouse skeletal muscle by integration, consensus annotation, and analysis of 23 newly collected scRNAseq datasets and 88 publicly available single-cell (scRNAseq) and single-nucleus (snRNAseq) RNA-sequencing datasets. The resulting dataset includes more than 365,000 cells and spans a wide range of ages, injury, and repair conditions. Together, these data enabled identification of the predominant cell types in skeletal muscle, and resolved cell subtypes, including endothelial subtypes distinguished by vessel-type of origin, fibro-adipogenic progenitors defined by functional roles, and many distinct immune populations. The representation of different experimental conditions and the depth of transcriptome coverage enabled robust profiling of sparsely expressed genes. We built a densely sampled transcriptomic model of myogenesis, from stem cell quiescence to myofiber maturation, and identified rare, transitional states of progenitor commitment and fusion that are poorly represented in individual datasets. We performed spatial RNA sequencing of mouse muscle at three time points after injury and used the integrated dataset as a reference to achieve a high-resolution, local deconvolution of cell subtypes. We also used the integrated dataset to explore ligand-receptor co-expression patterns and identify dynamic cell-cell interactions in muscle injury response. We provide a public web tool to enable interactive exploration and visualization of the data. Our work supports the utility of large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data as a tool for biological discovery.},

We applied MERINGUE to a variety of spatially resolved transcriptomics datasets including multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), spatial transcriptomics, Slide-Seq, and aligned in situ hybridization (ISH) data.

  abstract = {The limited field of view of high-resolution microscopic images hinders the study of biological samples in a single shot. Stitching of microscope images (tiles) captured by the whole-slide imaging (WSI) technique solves this problem. However, stitching is challenging due to the repetitive textures of tissues, the non-informative background part of the slide, and the large number of tiles that impact performance and computational time. To address these challenges, we proposed the Fast and Robust Microscopic Image Stitching (FRMIS) algorithm, which relies on pairwise and global alignment. The speeded up robust features (SURF) were extracted and matched within a small part of the overlapping region to compute the transformation and align two neighboring tiles. In cases where the transformation could not be computed due to an insufficient number of matched features, features were extracted from the entire overlapping region. This enhances the efficiency of the algorithm since most of the computational load is related to pairwise registration and reduces misalignment that may occur by matching duplicated features in tiles with repetitive textures. Then, global alignment was achieved by constructing a weighted~graph where the weight of each edge is determined by the normalized~inverse of the~number of~matched features between two tiles. FRMIS has been evaluated on experimental and synthetic datasets from different modalities with different numbers of tiles and overlaps, demonstrating faster stitching time compared to existing algorithms such as the Microscopy Image Stitching Tool (MIST) toolbox. FRMIS outperforms MIST by 481\% for bright-field, 259\% for phase-contrast, and 282\% for fluorescence modalities, while also being robust to uneven illumination.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-deadliest cancer in the world, yet a deeper understanding of spatial patterns of gene expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains elusive. Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively characterize the immune cell types present in the TME, specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct immune cell populations within it. We show that the single cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in FFPE tissues, which has not been previously possible.},

Developers of analytical tools need to decide on the intrinsic molecular features of each cell that need to be considered, and how cell shape and morphological features are incorporated into the analysis. Also, optimal ways to compare different tissue samples at various length scales are still being sought.

However, distinguishing the boundaries of individual cells in such data is challenging and can hamper downstream analysis. Current methods generally approximate cells positions using nuclei stains. We describe a segmentation method, Baysor, that optimizes two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cell boundaries considering joint likelihood of transcriptional composition and cell morphology. While Baysor can take into account segmentation based on co-stains, it can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. To evaluate performance, we extend multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to incorporate immunostaining of cell boundaries. Using this and other benchmarks, we show that Baysor segmentation can, in some cases, nearly double the number of cells compared to existing tools while reducing segmentation artifacts. We demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of imaging-based spatial transcriptomics.},

The rapid evolution of ST methods, each with unique features, presents a challenge in selecting the most appropriate technology for specific research objectives. Here, we compare four imaging-based ST methods -- RNAscope HiPlex, Molecular Cartography, MERFISH/Merscope, and Xenium -- together with sequencing-based ST (Visium). These technologies were used to study cryosections of medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN), a tumor chosen for its distinct microanatomical features. Results Our analysis reveals that automated imaging-based ST methods are well suited to delineating the intricate MBEN microanatomy, capturing cell-type-specific transcriptome profiles. We devise approaches to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the different methods together with their unique attributes to guide method selection based on the research aim. Furthermore, we demonstrate how reimaging of slides after the ST analysis can markedly improve cell segmentation accuracy and integrate additional transcript and protein readouts to expand the analytical possibilities and depth of insights. Conclusions This study highlights key distinctions between various ST technologies and provides a set of parameters for evaluating their performance. Our findings aid in the informed choice of ST methods and delineate approaches for enhancing the resolution and breadth of spatial transcriptomic analyses, thereby contributing to advancing ST applications in solid tumor research.},

In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index ({\~P}*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index ({\~H}), a spatial relative diversity index ({\~R}), and a spatial dissimilarity index ({\~D}). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure/isolation index {\~P}*---which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments---and the spatial information theory index {\~H}---which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual---are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

In this paper we consider those situations in which a map of a spatial pattern has been produced at some cost and we wish to extract the maximum possible information. We review the stochastic models which have been proposed for spatial point patterns and discuss methods by which the fit of such a model can be tested. Certain models are shown to be the equilibrium distributions of spatial-temporal stochastic processes. The theory is illustrated by several case studies.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing has profiled molecular cell types in the mouse brain1,2, but cannot capture their spatial organization. Here we used an in situ sequencing method, STARmap PLUS3,4, to profile 1,022 genes in 3D at a voxel size of 194\,{\texttimes}\,194\,{\texttimes}\,345\,nm3, mapping 1.09 million high-quality cells across the adult mouse brain and spinal cord. We developed computational pipelines to segment, cluster and annotate 230 molecular cell types by single-cell gene expression and 106 molecular tissue regions by spatial niche gene expression. Joint analysis of molecular cell types and molecular tissue regions enabled a systematic molecular spatial cell-type nomenclature and identification of tissue architectures that were undefined in established brain anatomy. To create a transcriptome-wide spatial atlas, we integrated STARmap PLUS measurements with a published single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas1, imputing single-cell expression profiles of 11,844 genes. Finally, we delineated viral tropisms of a brain-wide transgene delivery tool, AAV-PHP.eB5,6. Together, this annotated dataset provides a single-cell resource that integrates the molecular spatial atlas, brain anatomy and the accessibility to genetic manipulation of the mammalian central nervous system.},

Cellpose was trained on a new dataset of highly varied images of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.},

It relies on recently developed statistical formulas for hypothesis testing, providing effective control of type I errors and yielding high statistical power. With a computationally efficient algorithm, which is based on penalized quasi-likelihood, SPARK is also scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of samples.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of changing the grain (the first level of spatial resolution possible with a given data set) and extent (the total area of the study) of landscape data on observed spatial patterns and to identify some general rules for comparing measures obtained at different scales. Simple random maps, maps with contagion (i.e., clusters of the same land cover type), and actual landscape data from USGS land use (LUDA) data maps were used in the analyses. Landscape patterns were compared using indices measuring diversity (H), dominance (D) and contagion (C). Rare land cover types were lost as grain became coarser. This loss could be predicted analytically for random maps with two land cover types, and it was observed in actual landscapes as grain was increased experimentally. However, the rate of loss was influenced by the spatial pattern. Land cover types that were clumped disappeared slowly or were retained with increasing grain, whereas cover types that were dispersed were lost rapidly. The diversity index decreased linearly with increasing grain size, but dominance and contagion did not show a linear relationship. The indices D and C increased with increasing extent, but H exhibited a variable response. The indices were sensitive to the number (m) of cover types observed in the data set and the fraction of the landscape occupied by each cover type (Pk); both m and Pkvaried with grain and extent. Qualitative and quantitative changes in measurements across spatial scales will differ depending on how scale is defined. Characterizing the relationships between ecological measurements and the grain or extent of the data may make it possible to predict or correct for the loss of information with changes in spatial scale.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades spatial point pattern analysis (SPPA) has become increasingly popular in ecological research. To direct future work in this area we review studies using SPPA techniques in ecology and related disciplines. We first summarize the key elements of SPPA in ecology (i.e. data types, summary statistics and their estimation, null models, comparison of data and models, and consideration of heterogeneity); second, we review how ecologists have used these key elements; and finally, we identify practical difficulties that are still commonly encountered and point to new methods that allow current key questions in ecology to be effectively addressed. Our review of 308 articles published over the period 1992--2012 reveals that a standard canon of SPPA techniques in ecology has been largely identified and that most of the earlier technical issues that occupied ecologists, such as edge correction, have been solved. However, the majority of studies underused the methodological potential offered by modern SPPA. More advanced techniques of SPPA offer the potential to address a variety of highly relevant ecological questions. For example, inhomogeneous summary statistics can quantify the impact of heterogeneous environments, mark correlation functions can include trait and phylogenetic information in the analysis of multivariate spatial patterns, and more refined point process models can be used to realistically characterize the structure of a wide range of patterns. Additionally, recent advances in fitting spatially-explicit simulation models of community dynamics to point pattern summary statistics hold the promise for solving the longstanding problem of linking pattern to process. All these newer developments allow ecologists to keep up with the increasing availability of spatial data sets provided by newer technologies, which allow point patterns and environmental variables to be mapped over large spatial extents at increasingly higher image resolutions.},

  abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in gaining insights into tumor development and progression. Conventional metrics typically capture the spatial differential between TME cellular patterns by either exploring the cell distributions in a pairwise fashion or aggregating the heterogeneity across multiple cell distributions without considering the spatial contribution. As such, none of the existing approaches has fully accounted for the simultaneous heterogeneity caused by both cellular diversity and spatial configurations of multiple cell categories. In this article, we propose an approach to leverage spatial entropy measures at multiple distance ranges to account for the spatial heterogeneity across different cellular organizations. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is applied to estimate FPC scores which are then served as predictors in a Cox regression model to investigate the impact of spatial heterogeneity in the TME on survival outcome, potentially adjusting for other confounders. Using a non-small cell lung cancer dataset (n = 153) as a case study, we found that the spatial heterogeneity in the TME cellular composition of CD14+ cells, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CK+ tumor cells, had a significant non-zero effect on the overall survival (p = 0.027). Furthermore, using a publicly available multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) triple-negative breast cancer dataset (n = 33), our proposed method identified a significant impact of cellular interactions between tumor and immune cells on the overall survival (p = 0.046). In simulation studies under different spatial configurations, the proposed method demonstrated a high predictive power by accounting for both clinical effect and the impact of spatial heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {The tumor microenvironment (TME), which characterizes the tumor and its surroundings, plays a critical role in understanding cancer development and progression. Recent advances in imaging techniques enable researchers to study spatial structure of the TME at a single-cell level. Investigating spatial patterns and interactions of cell subtypes within the TME provides useful insights into how cells with different biological purposes behave, which may consequentially impact a subject's clinical outcomes. We utilize a class of well-known spatial summary statistics, the K-function and its variants, to explore inter-cell dependence as a function of distances between cells. Using techniques from functional data analysis, we introduce an approach to model the association between these summary spatial functions and subject-level outcomes, while controlling for other clinical scalar predictors such as age and disease stage. In particular, we leverage the additive functional Cox regression model (AFCM) to study the nonlinear impact of spatial interaction between tumor and stromal cells on overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) data. The applicability of our approach is further validated using a publicly available multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) triple-negative breast cancer dataset.},

We demonstrate the performance of our method using experimental data from several technological platforms and simulations.

  abstract = {Multiplexed imaging enables the simultaneous spatial profiling of dozens of biological molecules in tissues at single-cell resolution. Extracting biologically relevant information, such as the spatial distribution of cell phenotypes from multiplexed tissue imaging data, involves a number of computational tasks, including image segmentation, feature extraction and spatially resolved single-cell analysis. Here, we present an end-to-end workflow for multiplexed tissue image processing and analysis that integrates previously developed computational tools to enable these tasks in a user-friendly and customizable fashion. For data quality assessment, we highlight the utility of napari-imc for interactively inspecting raw imaging data and the cytomapper R/Bioconductor package for image visualization in R. Raw data preprocessing, image segmentation and feature extraction are performed using the steinbock toolkit. We showcase two alternative approaches for segmenting cells on the basis of supervised pixel classification and pretrained deep learning models. The extracted single-cell data are then read, processed and analyzed in R. The protocol describes the use of community-established data containers, facilitating the application of R/Bioconductor packages for dimensionality reduction, single-cell visualization and phenotyping. We provide instructions for performing spatially resolved single-cell analysis, including community analysis, cellular neighborhood detection and cell--cell interaction testing using the imcRtools R/Bioconductor package. The workflow has been previously applied to imaging mass cytometry data, but can be easily adapted to other highly multiplexed imaging technologies. This protocol can be implemented by researchers with basic bioinformatics training, and the analysis of the provided dataset can be completed within 5--6 h.

Most available methods and software cannot smooth covariance matrices of dimension \$\$J{$>$}500\$\$; a recently introduced sandwich smoother is an exception but is not adapted to smooth covariance matrices of large dimensions, such as \$\$J= 10\{,\}000\$\$. We introduce two new methods that circumvent those problems: (1) a fast implementation of the sandwich smoother for covariance smoothing; and (2) a two-step procedure that first obtains the singular value decomposition of the data matrix and then smoothes the eigenvectors. These new approaches are at least an order of magnitude faster in high dimensions and drastically reduce computer memory requirements. The new approaches provide instantaneous (a few seconds) smoothing for matrices of dimension \$\$J=10\{,\}000\$\$and very fast (\$\${$<\$\$$}10~min) smoothing for \$\$J=100\{,\}000\$\$. R functions, simulations, and data analysis provide ready to use, reproducible, and scalable tools for practical data analysis of noisy high-dimensional functional data.},
