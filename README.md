# pasta: Pattern Analysis for Spatial Omics daTA
This repository contains code for the `pasta` vignette accompanying the [pasta preprint](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.01561).

## Disclaimer
This vignette should be a dynamic resource for people interested in spatial statistics for spatial omics data. The content is therefore subject to change. If you wish to contribute to this resource, feel free to open an issue or contact us via email.

## Installing all necessary R packages
R packages are specified in `renv.lock` can be installed using `renv::restore()`.

## Using `renv` and Python
Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed via `pip`. An installation via `renv` is possible but it can happen that `renv` creates a virtual environment that does not locate the correct Python version and it will not be able to find the shared libraries.
