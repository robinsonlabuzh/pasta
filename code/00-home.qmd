<p><small> Imaging-based data can be interpreted as a point pattern either via the transcript locations or via cell centroids. Alternatively, the segmented cellular outlines can be interpreted as an irregular lattice. High throughput (HTS)-based approaches are most often recorded on a regular lattice. If resolution is high enough, segmentation into cells can be done. This enables either point pattern or lattice data analysis [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015; @pebesmaSpatialDataScience2023; @raoExploringTissueArchitecture2021]. Depending on the data representation and the feature of interest, different approaches of data analysis are available. Shown are exemplary questions divided by feature of interest, type of analysis and their corresponding methods. Data: [left: @shiSpatialAtlasMouse2023; right: @10xVisium_Mouse].

This website provides an overview of exploratory data analysis techniques tailored to the data modalities arising from the two primary spatial omic methods: image-based methods (e.g., MERFISH, CosMx, Xenium, 4i, IMC) and HTS-based approaches (e.g., Visium, Slide-seq). It accompanies the corresponding publication [@emonsPastaPatternAnalysis2024] ( available from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01561)).

Imaging-based techniques yield subcellular-resolution images, allowing for the study of cells within their natural context. This data can be analysed as spatial point pattern where the points represent cells. Alternatively, we can rely on the segmentation of each individual cell and interpret the collection of all cells as an irregular lattice.

In contrast, HTS-based methods, produce data represented as a regularly spaced grid corresponding to the sampling locations (spots). Each location has the same area and consists of a collection of different measurements.

First, we consider the technology and categorise into a HTS-based or imaging-based approach. Second, we distinguish between univariate (one type of mark) and multivariate (more than one type of mark) methods and outline different methods in specific vignettes. In addition, we provide overview vignettes summarising the two approaches.
